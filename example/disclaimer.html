				  margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well 
				  as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, 
				  and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should 
				  not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p><br><p><strong>CFTC RULE 4.41</strong> - Hypothetical performance results have many 
				  inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those 
				  shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved 
				  by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the 
				  benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a 
				  particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely 
				  affect actual real trading results.</p></div>
