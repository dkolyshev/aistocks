The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose.</p><br/><p><strong>CFTC RULE 4.41</strong> - Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. One of the limitations of hypothetical performance results is that they are generally prepared with the benefit of hindsight. In addition, hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk. Variables such as the ability to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of trading losses as well as maintaining adequate liquidity are material points which can adversely affect actual real trading results.</p>

						              	<p>Percentage gainers are a great indicator of a stock's trajectory, whether it's one of the many stocks under $1 or a longstanding blue chip behemoth. Percentage gain is an easy way to gauge market sentiment around a particular stock, and its direction and value in terms of trading. Though the worth of a stock's price in terms of data is hotly debated by pundits and analysts, it certainly is the most frontline indicator of all the factors circulating around shares traded on the market.<br/><br/>                            The percentage gain is an even better indicator of what's been going on and what might happen in the near future. Identifying percentage gainers is a form of technical analysis that traders-and particularly day traders-use for finding stocks that have significant price movement.<br/><br/>                            Stocks with the biggest increase in price movement, expressed as a percent, is one of the key metrics for ensuring profitable trades.<br/><br/>                            With innovations happening at the blink of an eye, it can be daunting to keep up with all the latest trends in technology...<br/><br/>                            What is the latest disruptive tech?<br/><br/>                            Are FAANG+ stocks still profitable for the everyday investor?<br/><br/>                            Within this report you'll find the answers to these questions along with the hottest technology stocks at the moment.<br/><br/>                            </p>
